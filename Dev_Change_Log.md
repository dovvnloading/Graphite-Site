### `[Beta v.0.4.8]` - 2025-10-29

This release introduces a major new feature for handling and displaying code, significantly improving the user experience for developers and technical users. AI-generated responses containing code blocks are now automatically parsed and rendered in a dedicated, syntax-highlighted `CodeNode`, visually separating them from conversational text.

#### Added

*   **Added Automatic Code Block Detection and Syntax Highlighting.**
    *   **Feature:** The application can now automatically detect markdown-style code blocks (e.g., ` ```python...``` `) in AI responses. Each detected block is rendered in a new, specialized `CodeNode` with full syntax highlighting, powered by the `pygments` library. This makes code significantly easier to read, understand, and copy.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   A new `CodeNode` class was created in `graphite_node.py`, which uses a `QTextDocument` to render HTML generated by `pygments`, providing rich, styled text.
        *   The `handle_response` method in `graphite_app.py` was updated with a regex-based parser to intelligently split incoming AI responses into separate text and code segments.
        *   A new `ContentConnectionItem` was added to `graphite_items.py` to create a distinct visual link (a dashed line) between a parent `ChatNode` and its child `CodeNode`, clarifying their relationship.
        *   The `ChatSessionManager` was enhanced to serialize and deserialize the new `CodeNode`s and their connections, ensuring they are saved and loaded correctly with the chat graph.

#### Architectural Refactor

*   **Integrated `pygments` for Robust Syntax Highlighting.**
    *   **Problem:** Displaying code as plain text is difficult to read and unprofessional. A robust, extensible solution for code rendering was needed.
    *   **Solution:** The `pygments` library has been integrated as a core dependency. A new `CodeHighlighter` utility class was added to `graphite_node.py` to abstract the highlighting logic. This class dynamically generates CSS and HTML from Python code, supporting a wide range of languages and providing a high-quality, professional rendering experience within the new `CodeNode`. The system is designed to fall back gracefully to plain text if a language is not specified or recognized.

### `[Beta v.0.4.7]` - 2025-10-29

This release introduces the Command Palette, a major new usability feature that provides fast, keyboard-driven access to nearly all application functions. This update also includes a key architectural refactoring of item deletion logic, centralizing it to support the new command system and improve maintainability.

#### Added

*   **Added the Command Palette for Quick, Keyboard-Driven Actions (Ctrl+K).**
    *   **Feature:** Users can now press `Ctrl+K` to open a searchable command palette, similar to those found in modern code editors. This provides instant, text-based access to a wide range of actions, such as "Collapse All Nodes," "Delete Selected Items," "Generate Bar Chart," and "Fit All to View," dramatically speeding up user workflow.
    *   **Implementation:** The feature is powered by a new `CommandManager` class (`graphite_core.py`) responsible for registering commands, their aliases, and context-sensitive availability (e.g., "Delete Selected" is only available when items are selected). A new `CommandPaletteDialog` (`graphite_dialogs.py`) provides the search UI, and the main `ChatWindow` now registers all core application functions as commands.

#### Architectural Refactor

*   **Refactored and Centralized Item Deletion Logic.**
    *   **Problem:** Previously, the logic for deleting different item types was fragmented across the codebase. The complex logic for deleting a `ChatNode` (which involves re-parenting its children) was located exclusively within its context menu, making it non-reusable for a global "Delete Selected" command.
    *   **Solution:** All deletion logic has been centralized within the `ChatScene` class. The `ChatNode` deletion algorithm was moved into a new `delete_chat_node` method. The primary `deleteSelectedItems` method was enhanced to iterate through all selected items and call the correct deletion function for each type (`ChatNode`, `Frame`, `Note`, etc.). This refactoring was essential for implementing the unified "Delete Selected Items" command in the new Command Palette.

### `[Beta v.0.4.6]` - 2025-10-29

This release introduces a powerful new usability feature for focusing on specific conversation paths and completes a significant architectural refactoring to improve modularity and resolve critical import errors.

#### Added

*   **Added "Hide Other Branches" Feature to Focus on Specific Conversations.**
    *   **Feature:** Users can now right-click any node and select "Hide Other Branches" from the context menu. This action visually dims and de-emphasizes all nodes that are not part of the selected node's direct lineage (i.e., its ancestors and descendants). This allows users to instantly focus on a single, coherent line of thought within a complex, branching graph.
    *   **Implementation:** The feature is managed by a new state variable and a `toggle_branch_visibility()` method within the `ChatScene` class. When activated, the method traces the full path of the selected branch and sets an `is_dimmed` flag on all other nodes. The rendering logic in `ChatNode` was updated to draw a semi-transparent overlay when this flag is active. The context menu dynamically updates to "Show All Branches," allowing the user to easily restore the view.

#### Architectural Refactor

*   **Decomposed the monolithic `graphite_items.py` module for improved modularity.**
    *   **Problem:** The `graphite_items.py` file was responsible for both general-purpose canvas items (like `Frame`, `Note`, `Pin`) and the highly complex, multi-component `ChatNode`. This violated the Single Responsibility Principle and made the codebase harder to navigate and maintain.
    *   **Solution:** All classes directly related to the chat node functionality have been extracted into a new, dedicated `graphite_node.py` file. This includes `ChatNode`, `TextBlock`, `ImageBlock`, `ScrollBar`, and `ChatNodeContextMenu`. This refactoring clarifies the separation of concerns, with `graphite_items.py` now serving as a library for generic canvas elements and `graphite_node.py` encapsulating all chat node logic.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a fatal application crash (`ImportError`) caused by a circular dependency.**
    *   **Problem:** The architectural refactoring inadvertently created a circular import loop where `graphite_node.py` imported `graphite_items.py`, which in turn imported `graphite_node.py`, causing the application to crash on startup.
    *   **Solution:** The unnecessary import of `ChatNode` from `graphite_items.py` was identified and removed. The classes within `graphite_items.py` do not need compile-time knowledge of `ChatNode`, as they operate on instances passed at runtime. Removing this import successfully broke the dependency cycle and restored application stability.

### `[Beta v.0.4.5]` - 2025-10-29

This release addresses several significant visual and architectural flaws within the `ChatNode` component that were introduced in the previous version. The primary focus was on creating a robust and permanent solution to the layout conflicts between the text content, the scrollbar, and the collapse/expand button, ensuring a clean and professional UI under all conditions.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a critical UI rendering bug where the collapse/expand button would overlap the text content.**
    *   **Problem:** Previous attempts to fix the layout resulted in a state where, if a node's content was *not* long enough to require a scrollbar, the collapse button would be drawn directly on top of the text field.
    *   **Solution:** The rendering and layout architecture of the `ChatNode` has been fundamentally corrected. A permanent, reserved space ("gutter") is now established on the right side of every node. The text layout logic was updated to *never* enter this gutter, guaranteeing that its content can never overlap with UI controls. The button's positioning logic was then simplified to reliably place it within this safe, reserved area, resolving the conflict in all states.
*   **Fixed a major regression where the scrollbar would overlap the collapse button.**
    *   **Problem:** An incorrect fix for the text overlap issue reintroduced the original bug where the scrollbar and collapse button would render on top of each other, making both components difficult to use.
    *   **Solution:** The `paint` method was corrected to implement a strict, state-dependent positioning rule. It now explicitly checks if the scrollbar is visible. If it is, the button is placed to the left of the scrollbar; otherwise, it is placed at the far-right edge of the node. This dual-state logic ensures the two components can never occupy the same space.
*   **Fixed a fatal application crash (`QPainter::end: Painter ended with 2 saved states`) and disappearing nodes.**
    *   **Problem:** An incorrect attempt to fix the rendering order led to a critical painter state imbalance, where `painter.save()` was called without a corresponding `painter.restore()`. This corrupted the Qt rendering pipeline, causing the application to crash and `ChatNode` items to fail to render entirely.
    *   **Solution:** The `paint` method has been corrected to use a properly balanced `painter.save()`/`painter.restore()` block. This block now safely encapsulates the clipping and drawing of the text content, ensuring the painter state is always correctly managed and preventing any rendering crashes or visual corruption.

### `[Beta v.0.4.4]` - 2025-10-28

This release enhances canvas usability by introducing a node collapse feature, allowing users to manage complex conversation graphs more effectively. It also includes fixes for visual artifacts that appeared as a result of the new functionality.

#### Added

*   **Added Node Collapse/Expand Functionality.**
    *   **Feature:** Users can now minimize nodes to a compact state, reducing visual clutter and making it easier to navigate large, branching conversations. This is a crucial tool for focusing on specific thought threads while hiding less relevant ones.
    *   **Implementation:** The `ChatNode` class now manages a `is_collapsed` state. The feature is accessible via two intuitive methods: a new "Collapse/Expand" option in the right-click context menu, and a hover-activated icon that appears in the top-right corner of the node for quick, direct interaction. When a node's state is changed, all associated connections and parent frames automatically adjust to the new geometry.
*   **Added Persistence for Node Collapse State.**
    *   **Feature:** The collapsed or expanded state of every node is now saved with the chat session and is fully restored when the session is loaded.
    *   **Implementation:** The `ChatSessionManager` has been updated to serialize the `is_collapsed` boolean for each node into the database and deserialize it upon loading, ensuring a consistent and predictable layout across sessions.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a critical UI bug where the scrollbar remained visible on collapsed nodes.**
    *   **Problem:** When a node with scrollable content was collapsed, its scrollbar was not being hidden, leaving a detached and visually disruptive UI element on the canvas.
    *   **Solution:** The logic in the `ChatNode._update_geometry_for_state()` method has been corrected to explicitly set the `ScrollBar`'s visibility to `False` whenever the node enters a collapsed state, completely resolving the visual artifact.

### `[Beta v.0.4.3]` - 2025-10-28

This is a minor release focused on improving the core visual aesthetic of the application's chat canvas, moving from a flat design to one with more perceived depth and professionalism.

#### Changed

*   **Enhanced the visual design of `ChatNode` items for a more professional aesthetic.**
    *   **Problem:** The previous design used solid, flat colors (green and blue) for the node backgrounds. While functional, this created a visually simplistic and less polished look.
    *   **Solution:** The node's rendering logic in the `ChatNode.paint()` method has been updated. The solid color fill has been replaced with a subtle gray gradient, giving the nodes a sense of depth. The node's origin (user or AI) is now indicated by a colored outline (green for user, blue for AI) rather than the entire background, resulting in a cleaner and more professional appearance.

### `[Beta v.0.4.2]` - 2025-10-27

This release completes the major UI overhaul by standardizing all window frames across the application, resulting in a more professional and cohesive user experience. The focus was on eliminating custom, non-native windowing solutions in favor of robust, OS-level implementations.

#### Changed

*   **Unified the Main Window and all Dialogs to use Native OS Window Frames.**
    *   **Problem:** The main application window and several key dialogs (`Library`, `Help`, `About`, `Activation`) were using a custom, frameless implementation that required significant boilerplate code to replicate basic window functions. This created a visual and functional disconnect from standard dialogs and lacked the robustness of native window management.
    *   **Solution:** All custom frameless window implementations have been removed and replaced with standard, native window frames. The `CustomTitleBar` class is now obsolete, and all windows now leverage the host operating system's window manager for a consistent look, feel, and behavior (including features like window snapping and native shadows).

*   **Improved User Help Dialog Content.**
    *   **Problem:** The descriptions in the "Help" dialog were overly brief and often failed to explain *how* or *why* a feature should be used, limiting their value for new users.
    *   **Solution:** All help text has been rewritten to be more detailed, descriptive, and action-oriented. The new content provides clear, step-by-step instructions, explains core application concepts (like "Contextual Replies"), and includes keyboard shortcuts to improve feature discovery and user onboarding.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a critical bug where the native close ("x") button was disabled on all refactored windows.**
    *   **Details:** The process of removing the custom frameless hints inadvertently dropped the `WindowCloseButtonHint` flag, causing the window manager to disable the close button. This flag has been explicitly re-added to the main window and all refactored dialogs, restoring essential functionality.
*   **Fixed an architectural flaw by relocating the main window icon logic.**
    *   **Details:** The application's primary icon was being incorrectly set from within the now-obsolete `CustomTitleBar` class. This logic has been moved to the main `ChatWindow`'s `__init__` method, where it properly belongs.

### `[Beta v.0.4.1]` - 2025-10-27

This release is a continuation of the major architectural refactoring initiated in the previous version. The focus was to dismantle the large `graphite_graphics.py` file, further improving modularity and clarifying the separation between UI components.

#### Architectural Refactor

*   **Decomposed the monolithic `graphite_graphics.py` module.**
    *   **Problem:** Following the initial UI refactor, the `graphite_graphics.py` module remained overly large, containing both the individual graphical items (`ChatNode`, `Frame`, `Note`) and the container classes that manage them (`ChatScene`, `ChatView`). This co-location of distinct responsibilities hindered clarity and maintainability.
    *   **Solution:** The single file has been broken down into two new, more focused modules, establishing a clearer hierarchy between the view and its contents:
        *   `graphite_items.py`: This module now exclusively contains all `QGraphicsItem` subclasses. These classes represent the individual, interactive elements on the canvas (`ChatNode`, `ConnectionItem`, `Frame`, `Note`, `ChartItem`, `NavigationPin`, etc.).
        *   `graphite_view.py`: This module houses the container classes (`ChatScene` and `ChatView`), which are responsible for managing, displaying, and orchestrating interactions with the graphical items.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a critical `ImportError` crash caused by a circular dependency.**
    *   **Details:** The refactoring process inadvertently created a circular import loop: `graphite_widgets` imported `graphite_items`, which imported `graphite_dialogs`, which in turn imported `graphite_widgets`, causing the application to crash on startup. The issue was resolved by restoring a "dummy class" forward declaration for `NavigationPin` within `graphite_widgets.py`, successfully breaking the import cycle.

### `[Beta v.0.4.0]` - 2025-10-27

This release introduces a major architectural refactoring of the user interface layer. The primary goal was to dismantle the monolithic `graphite_ui.py` file to improve modularity, resolve circular dependency issues, and enhance long-term maintainability.

#### Architectural Refactor

*   **Decomposed the monolithic UI module.**
    *   **Problem:** The `graphite_ui.py` file had grown to include over 25 distinct classes, mixing responsibilities such as styling, core widgets, dialogs, and complex graphics scene items. This made the code difficult to navigate, debug, and maintain.
    *   **Solution:** The single file has been broken down into four new, single-responsibility modules:
        *   `graphite_styles.py`: Centralizes the `StyleSheet` class and color constants.
        *   `graphite_widgets.py`: Contains reusable `QWidget` subclasses like `CustomTitleBar`, `LoadingOverlay`, and `PinOverlay`.
        *   `graphite_dialogs.py`: Consolidates all `QDialog`-based classes.
        *   `graphite_graphics.py`: Contains all core `QGraphics...` components, including custom items, the `ChatScene`, and the `ChatView`.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed multiple critical `ImportError` crashes** that arose during the refactoring process.
    *   **Details:** Resolved errors caused by incorrect import paths for Qt classes. `QAction` was moved from `QtWidgets` to its correct module, `QtGui`. The class `QGraphicsPathStroker` was corrected to its proper name, `QPainterPathStroker`, fixing both the import and its usage within the `ConnectionItem` class.
*   **Fixed a `TypeError` crash related to the Frame animation.**
    *   **Details:** The `valueChanged` signal of the `QVariantAnimation` used for the frame's selection outline was incorrectly connected to the `QGraphicsItem.update` method, passing an unexpected argument. This was resolved by using a `lambda` function to ensure the method is called without arguments, stopping the crash loop.

### `[Beta v.0.3.0]` - 2025-10-27

This release transitions the application from a purely functional prototype to a distributable product by introducing a robust licensing and user agreement framework. The primary focus is on ensuring a professional first-run experience, protecting the software with a trial period, and providing clear developer attribution.

#### Added

*   **Added a 5-Day Trial and Licensing System.**
    *   **Feature:** The application now operates in a fully-featured demo mode for 5 days from the first launch. After the trial period expires, the user must enter a valid license key to continue using the software.
    *   **Implementation:** A new `graphite_licensing.py` module has been created to manage all licensing logic. It creates a persistent state file (`~/.graphite/session.dat`) to securely track the first launch date, EULA acceptance, and activation status. The main application startup sequence in `graphite_app.py` has been modified to enforce these checks before the main window is launched.
*   **Added a Mandatory End-User License Agreement (EULA).**
    *   **Feature:** On the very first launch, users are now presented with a modal EULA dialog. The application will not run unless the user scrolls to the bottom and explicitly agrees to the terms, which include a disclaimer of warranty and a liability clause for generated content.
    *   **Implementation:** A new `EULADialog` was created in `graphite_ui.py` with logic to ensure full review of the text. The `LicenseManager` tracks the acceptance state, preventing the app from running until the EULA is accepted.
*   **Added an "About" Dialog and Developer Credits.**
    *   **Feature:** A new "About" dialog is now accessible from the main toolbar, providing users with application version info, developer credits (name, contact), and a direct link to the project's GitHub repository. It also clearly displays the current license status (Trial, Licensed, or Expired).
    *   **Implementation:** An `AboutDialog` class was added to `graphite_ui.py` and integrated into the `ChatWindow` toolbar.
*   **Added an In-App Activation Dialog.**
    *   **Feature:** Users can now activate their software from within the application using a dedicated "Activate" dialog, which appears automatically when the trial expires or can be accessed from the toolbar.
    *   **Implementation:** The `ActivationDialog` class in `graphite_ui.py` provides an interface for key entry and validation against the logic in `graphite_licensing.py`.

#### Changed

*   **The Main Window Title is now dynamic and reflects the license status.** The title bar will display "Graphite (Trial - X days remaining)" during the trial period and "Graphite (Licensed)" after successful activation, providing clear and persistent feedback to the user.
*   **The main toolbar has been updated** to include buttons for the new "About" and "Activate" dialogs, making these features easily accessible.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a bug in the EULA dialog where the "Agree" button would remain disabled** if the agreement text was too short to require scrolling. The logic was corrected to enable the button immediately if the content is fully visible upon opening, ensuring a smooth user experience regardless of screen resolution or content length.

### `[Beta v.0.2.2]` - 2024-05-25

This release introduces support for any OpenAI-compatible API endpoint as an alternative to a local Ollama instance. It also includes a significant user experience overhaul for model and provider selection, resolving critical design flaws and improving usability.

#### Added

*   **Added support for OpenAI-Compatible API Endpoints.**
    *   **Feature:** Users can now switch from using a local Ollama instance to any remote API service that is compatible with the OpenAI API specification (e.g., OpenAI, Groq, OpenRouter, or self-hosted solutions like LiteLLM). (Credits for first conceptual buildout/iteration of implimentations - https://github.com/1818TusculumSt)
    *   **Implementation:** A new `api_provider.py` module was created to act as a router, abstracting all LLM calls and directing them to either Ollama or the configured API endpoint based on the user's selection. All agent classes (`ChatAgent`, `KeyTakeawayAgent`, etc.) were refactored to use this new provider instead of calling `ollama` directly.
*   **Added Per-Task Model Configuration for API Mode.**
    *   **Feature:** When using an API provider, users can configure different models for different tasks (Title Generation, Chat/Analysis, and Chart Data Extraction) to optimize for cost, speed, and capability.
    *   **Implementation:** An `APISettingsDialog` was created, allowing users to enter their API credentials, load a list of available models from the endpoint, and assign a specific model to each task category.

#### Changed

*   **Overhauled the Model and Provider Selection UX.**
    *   **Problem:** The previous UI design for model selection was confusing, with separate and sometimes hidden buttons for different providers. This created a frustrating and non-discoverable user experience.
    *   **Solution:** The toolbar has been redesigned with a clear, two-part system:
        1.  A "Mode" dropdown to explicitly select the provider (`Ollama (Local)` or `API Endpoint`).
        2.  A single, consistently visible "Settings" button. This button is now context-aware and will open the appropriate configuration dialog (`ModelSelectionDialog` for Ollama or `APISettingsDialog` for an API) based on the currently selected mode. This resolves all ambiguity and makes the feature intuitive to use.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a critical UI bug where the API settings button was permanently invisible.**
    *   **Problem:** A logic error in the toolbar setup (`self.api_settings_btn.setVisible(False)`) caused the button to configure the API to be hidden, making the entire feature inaccessible.
    *   **Solution:** The erroneous line was removed, and the toolbar was refactored to use the new unified "Settings" button, ensuring the correct dialog is always accessible.
*   **Fixed an architectural violation where UI components were defined outside of `graphite_ui.py`.**
    *   **Problem:** The `APISettingsDialog` was incorrectly defined within the main application file (`graphite_app.py`), breaking the project's modular structure.
    *   **Solution:** The `APISettingsDialog` class has been moved to its proper location within `graphite_ui.py`, restoring the architectural integrity and separation of concerns.

### `[Beta v.0.2.1]` - 2024-05-25

This release focuses on critical stability and functionality fixes, primarily addressing issues within the API provider integration and the core UI rendering system.

#### Fixed

*   **Fixed a critical application crash when loading models from the Google Gemini API.**
    *   **Problem:** The application would crash with a `TypeError` when fetching the model list from Gemini. A deep-dive analysis revealed this was due to a fundamental incompatibility between the installed `google-generativeai` library and the current data structure of the API's response. The previous design, which relied on dynamic model discovery, proved to be too brittle for this provider.
    *   **Solution:** The architecture for the Gemini provider has been completely refactored. The brittle dynamic discovery process has been removed and replaced with a static, hard-coded list of known-stable Gemini models. The API Settings UI now intelligently adapts, hiding non-functional controls (e.g., "Load Models") for the Gemini provider and populating the model list instantly and reliably.

*   **Fixed a critical logic error preventing chat messages from being sent to Gemini models.**
    *   **Problem:** After successfully configuring a Gemini model, all chat attempts would fail with an "Error: message cannot be blank."
    *   **Solution:** The root cause was identified in the `api_provider.chat()` function, where a `pop()` operation was incorrectly removing the user's current message from the conversation history before the payload was sent to the API. This line has been removed, ensuring the complete and correct conversation context is now sent with every request.

*   **Fixed a fatal application crash on startup due to incorrect UI class definition order.**
    *   **Problem:** A regression from a previous refactor caused the application to crash on launch with an `ImportError` and underlying `NameError` exceptions. Classes within `graphite_ui.py` (e.g., `ColorPickerDialog`, `ConnectionItem`) were being referenced before they were defined, halting the module loading process.
    *   **Solution:** The class definitions within `graphite_ui.py` have been meticulously reordered to ensure a correct, top-to-bottom dependency resolution. All classes are now defined before they are instantiated or referenced, resolving the startup crash.

*   **Fixed a fatal UI rendering crash related to the `ChartItem` class.**
    *   **Problem:** The application would enter a crash loop during the UI paint event, raising an `AttributeError` for a non-existent `QPainter.RenderHint` (`HighQualityAntialiasing`).
    *   **Solution:** The erroneous line has been removed from the `ChartItem.paint()` method. Rendering quality is preserved by other existing and correct render hints (`SmoothPixmapTransform`), and the crash is fully resolved.

#### Changed

*   **Updated the static model list for the Google Gemini provider.**
    *   The hard-coded list of Gemini models was updated to include the latest stable releases available through the public API, including the `gemini-2.5-pro` and `gemini-2.5-flash` series, ensuring users have access to current and powerful models.

### `[Beta v.0.2.0]` - 2024-05-23

#### Architectural Refactor

*   This update introduces a major architectural refactoring to improve the project's structure, maintainability, and scalability. The application has been transitioned from a single, monolithic script into a modular, multi-file structure with a clear separation of concerns. The primary goal of this refactor was to decouple the User Interface, Core Logic, and AI Agent services from one another.

*   The new project structure is as follows:
    *   `graphite_app.py`: Serves as the main application entry point. It contains the primary `ChatWindow` class and is responsible for initializing and launching the application.
    *   `graphite_ui.py`: Consolidates all classes related to the User Interface layer. This includes all Qt widgets, dialogs, custom graphics items for the scene (`ChatNode`, `ConnectionItem`, `Frame`, etc.), and view components (`ChatView`, `ChatScene`).
    *   `graphite_core.py`: Manages the application's core logic and data persistence. It contains the `ChatDatabase` class for all SQLite operations and the `ChatSessionManager` for handling the serialization and deserialization of chat sessions.
    *   `graphite_agents.py`: Isolates all logic related to AI model interaction. This module contains the base `ChatAgent` as well as specialized tool agents (`KeyTakeawayAgent`, `ExplainerAgent`, `ChartDataAgent`) and their corresponding `QThread` workers for asynchronous processing.
    *   `graphite_config.py`: A centralized location for application-wide configuration constants, such as task identifiers and default model names.
    *   `api_provider.py`: A dedicated module to abstract away the differences between various AI providers (Ollama, OpenAI-compatible, Google Gemini), presenting a unified interface to the rest of the application.
